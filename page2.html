    <p1>By Aprajita Pandey </p1> <br><br>
    <p2>I used to think the phrase “rise and grind” was just a punchline in motivational and mindset content. That is, until I stumbled upon the daily routine of Emma Grede, the force behind Good American and a seasoned Shark Tank investor. 
In New York, “no” is the city’s favourite word. “No Ubers available.” “No table without a reservation.” “No, he’s not calling you back.” 

But for me, “no” was always a challenge. I’d RSVP “yes” to everything, even if it meant running myself ragged. But for Emma, “no” is a form of radical self-respect. A complete sentence. No guilt. No explanation. Just boundaries. 
I wondered: could I tap into my own Emma Grede for a week? </p2><br><br>

<p3>Spoiler alert: It wasn’t easy. But then again, neither is becoming a mogul.</p3><br><br>

<p2> I lived the Grede way, broke it down into chunks — one for every part of the day and gave up my obsession with “just right.” Emma’s life is an artistically choreographed hustle of early mornings, intense focus, and laser-sharp decisions. Could I live like her every day? I’m not sure. But I will always say this: there’s power in waking up early, checking off your to-do list before most people have had their coffee, and making time to focus on what really matters. The rest? Well, it’ll come if you’re relentless about building the life you want. And as for the “no” challenge, maybe “no” isn’t a rejection, maybe it’s a redirection – to something that matters more. 
<br><br>
As Grede would put it: </p2> <br><br>

<p3>You’ve got to give yourself permission to be unapologetic in pursuit of your goals.</p3> <br><br>
<p2>So, I threw on my metaphorical and literal power suit and set out to channel my inner boss. <br><br> Here’s how it went: </p2>
<br><br>
<p4>Monday: How Shifting Your Mindset Can Kickstart Your Day </p4><br><br>
<p2>The first morning felt like a pop quiz I didn’t study for – and trust me, no one was handing out gold stars. Emma starts her days by getting up at 5:00 AM, it’s that magical time before the world wakes up, where silence holds the power of potential. I set my alarm, not knowing whether I’d make it out of bed, but I did it. I climbed out of bed, grabbed my phone and started scrolling through my to-do list in an attempt to match Grede’s commitment to get it done before anyone even thinks about getting up. 
I’m not going to lie, that first morning was a haze. But by 5:30 AM, I was already knee-deep in emails, reflecting her advice to stay ahead by getting ahead of others. It was strange- for once, my emails didn’t seem like an overwhelming tidal wave. They were just… part of the rhythm.
Grede swears by her morning routine which incorporates a workout and a healthy breakfast – and, of course, acknowledging her blessings before engaging in a workout to get her day started. I couldn’t help but wonder… if the way we speak to ourselves first thing in the morning sets the tone for everything else. So before lacing up my sneakers and hitting the mat, I took a moment to breathe in my blessings and then, like slipping into my favourite pair of sandals, I slipped into a better mindset. Because if you want to change your actions, you’ve got to start by changing your thoughts.</p2>
<br><br>
<p4>
Tuesday: The Power of “No” – And the Liberation That Comes with It </p4>
<br><br>
<p2>Emma is all about balance – or at least, balancing chaos with focus. She has a rule: “No” is a full sentence and this was more than just a revelation. I decided to try it: no justifying, no sugarcoating. Just clean, unapologetic boundaries. 
I felt powerful, Like I’d just Marie Kondo’d my entire calendar. 
Sometimes the most radical act of self-care… is knowing when to walk away. <p2>
<br><br>
<p4>
Wednesday: Blazer Energy 
</p4>
<br><br>
I met corporate – and honestly, I looked good. 
Emma doesn’t dress down – even when she’s working from home. So, I put away the hoodie and pulled out the girlboss fit – a blue vest, paired it with my favourite denim jeans and finished the look with a pop of pink sandals. Kendall Jenner bun, confidence, and an espresso shot of energy all packed into one outfit. It wasn’t just clothes, darling, it was armour for the day ahead.
I strutted into my classroom like it was a boardroom. And guess what? I showed up different. It was time to step into the day like I was ready to conquer it – one confident stride at a time. 
<br><br>
<p4>
Thursday: Owning the Room – Even If You’re the Quiet Type
</p4>
<br><br>
Confidence isn’t always loud. Sometimes, it’s a slow sip of conviction.
Emma Grede doesn’t just walk into rooms – she arrives. She makes presence look effortless. But I’m not Emma, I’m the girl who rehearses her Starbucks name. 
So today, I practiced presence. I didn’t zone out during lectures. I took notes with purpose. I made sure to engage with my professors, asking questions when I wasn’t sure and when I contributed to class discussions – I didn’t hold back. I spoke the truth. 
By the end of the day, a classmate told me “You seeemed so focussed.” And I thought: maybe confidence isn’t about being the loudest voice in the room. Maybe its about knowing you’re exactly where you’re meant to be. 
<br><br>

<p4>
Friday: Ditching Perfection – Can Progress Be Enough? 
</p4>
<br><br>
Emma chases momentum and not perfection. So, I ditched my overthinking and hit publish a blog post that was 95% ready. 
Did I cringe? Yes. Did anyone notice the typo in paragraph three? Probably not. 
I skipped the second-guessing. I finished tasks instead of polishing them into oblivion. And I felt… free. Like I’d finally given myself permission to move. 
Perfection was my leash. Emma helped me snap it. 
<br><br>

<p4>
Saturday: Merging Life and Hustle – The Family Affair 
</p4>
<br><br>
If Emma can build an empire with her husband, I can brainstorm with my sister.
Emma works alongside her husband. Their boardroom is built on trust — and probably takeout. I took a page from her playbook and invited my sister into my content planning. My mom weighed in on my new site design (with a lot of unsolicited but heartfelt advice).
I realized: productivity doesn’t have to be sterile. It can have love in the background, laughter in the middle, and a FaceTime call between slides.
Emma doesn’t separate life and business — she stitches them together like a custom blazer.
<br><br>

<p4>
Sunday: The Night Shift 
</p4>
<br><br>
While Emma Grede’s nighttime routine is all about reading and skincare, it’s clear she doesn’t burn the midnight oil in the traditional sense. She admits she has a soft spot for late nights, not wanting to miss out on what the world might be up to. Still, she’s made peace with winding down — no phones after 9 PM, jotting down ideas, and curling up with a good book for 20 minutes before bed. It’s a reminder that even a CEO needs to prioritize relaxation and personal time in the evenings, rather than working nonstop.
<br><br>Emma Grede, Co-Founder and CEO of Good American <br>
<p3>
  "Even though I’m not into the club scene, I still love a late night. I’m that person who's always saying, ‘I don’t want to miss something.”</p3>
<br>— Into The Gloss<br><br>
By the end of the week, I wasn’t just following Emma Grede’s routine. I was embodying her philosophy: Be intentional. Be unapologetic. Be in charge.
<br><br>And I gained something even better — clarity, confidence, and a little taste of the CEO life.
<br><br>Maybe we all have an Emma in us — she just needs a 5:00 AM wake-up call to rise.
