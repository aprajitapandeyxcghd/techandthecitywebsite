    <h2>I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder‚Ä¶</h2>

    <p>Is it possible to climb the corporate ladder when you can barely climb out of bed?</p>

    <p>In a world that worships #girlboss energy and 5AM miracle mornings, no one ever talks about the mornings you wake up feeling like the human embodiment of a rain cloud. The ones where your coffee tastes like regret and your email inbox looks like a battlefield you never signed up to fight in.</p>

    <p>Once upon a time (read: three months ago), I thought depression was something you could politely ignore during business hours ‚Äî like a fire alarm during a Zoom call. Spoiler alert: it isn‚Äôt. Depression doesn‚Äôt clock out when you clock in.</p>

    <p>And yet, somehow, I had to find a way to keep producing, keep smiling, keep showing up ‚Äî even when every cell in my body was screaming for a duvet day.</p>

    <p>So I decided to stop pretending to be the girl who‚Äôs thriving and start figuring out how to be the girl who‚Äôs surviving ‚Äî stylishly, strategically, and yes, a little messily. I started breaking down my days into the smallest imaginable wins. Reply to one email. Attend one meeting. Finish one task. Celebrate, repeat, survive.</p>

    <p>Slowly, I realized that productivity doesn‚Äôt always look like smashing your to-do list or launching a side hustle at midnight. Sometimes, productivity is brushing your hair before a Zoom call, even if you cry five minutes later. Sometimes it's remembering to eat lunch before 4 PM. Sometimes, it‚Äôs just not giving up.</p>

    <p>The world loves a success story with a clean narrative arc: woke up at 5AM, journaled, meditated, crushed it. But my story doesn‚Äôt sound like that. It‚Äôs more like: woke up feeling like a wrung-out dishrag, cried a little, sent a scary email, rewarded self with chocolate, survived to tell the tale.</p>

    <p>And you know what? That‚Äôs still a kind of success.</p>

    <p>Maybe we need to redefine ambition. Maybe it‚Äôs not about grinding ourselves into dust chasing a version of ourselves that only exists in Pinterest quotes. Maybe ambition is showing up authentically ‚Äî messy, tired, real ‚Äî and still daring to dream.</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm learning to be proud of the tiny victories. To treat my bad days not as failures, but as part of the rhythm of being human. To measure success not by the number of tasks I cross off, but by the amount of grace I give myself.</p>

    <p>And if that means crying at my desk one moment and crushing a presentation the next, so be it.</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm not thriving every day. But I‚Äôm surviving ‚Äî and on some days, that‚Äôs the bravest thing I do.</p>
